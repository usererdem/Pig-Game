# Pig-Game

This is a two-player game. Player one starts the game by rolling a dice.
The game will add the dice values you roll in your current score and show it in the "current box".

If you roll 1 the player will lose the points in the "current box" and also lose the turn.

If you press the "hold" button before rolling 1, your points in the "current box" will be added to your total score.

Whoever gets to a hundred first will win.

You can always reset the game and play again simply by pressing the "New Game" button.

Have fun and good luck!
